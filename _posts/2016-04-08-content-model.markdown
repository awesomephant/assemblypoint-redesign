Set up a list of _content types_ that will make up the website. This could include things like articles, exhibitions or ecommerce items. Each content type has a list of specific bits of information that are related to it. For an exhibtion, this might include the name of the show, a description, participating artists, opening times and so on.

Storing all these pieces of information in a structured way allows us to keep the site maintainable as the amount of content grows.
